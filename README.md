![images (2)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/338d1b55-1880-473d-90fa-ea4af4fa79c7)

#**ðŸ“Œ Project Overview**

This project explores and analyzes a dataset of 7,700+ Netflix titles (movies & TV shows) as of 2019. It includes data cleaning, NLP-driven feature engineering, advanced visual storytelling, and a content-based recommendation engine using machine learning.

#**ðŸ§  Key Features**

**1. Data Wrangling:** Handled missing values, unnested nested fields (cast, director, genre, country), and preprocessed data.

**2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducted univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis with 15+ insightful visualizations.

**3. Text Processing & Feature Engineering:** Built a consolidated content_detail feature using TF-IDF Vectorization.

**4. Dimensionality Reduction:** Applied PCA to improve model performance.

**5. Clustering Algorithms:** Implemented K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering with evaluation via Silhouette Score, Elbow Method, and Dendrograms.

**6. Recommendation System:** Developed a content-based recommender using cosine similarity for personalized suggestions.
   
**7. Hypothesis Testing:** Used Z-test and T-test to derive business insights from genre, duration, and release patterns.

#**ðŸ›  Technologies & Tools**
**Languages & Libraries:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, NLTK

**Machine Learning:** K-Means, Agglomerative Clustering, PCA, Cosine Similarity

**NLP Techniques:** Tokenization, Stopword Removal, Lemmatization, TF-IDF

**Statistical Analysis:** SciPy, statsmodels (Z-test, T-test)

**Version Control:** Git & GitHub

#**ðŸ“ˆ Business Impact**

Identified trends in global content contribution, genre popularity, and release patterns.

Created a scalable, production-ready recommendation system.

Delivered actionable insights to enhance content targeting and viewer retention strategies.
